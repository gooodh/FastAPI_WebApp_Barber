# Project: Telegram Bot from MiniApp to FastAPI

This project is a demo bot for a barbershop using **FastAPI** to raise a web server and process requests, as well as with the implementation of a Telegram MiniApp for accepting applications. The bot works through webhooks and interacts with a database on **POSTGRES** using asynchronous alchemy (**SQLAlchemy**, the **POSTGRES** engine). The web application supports static pages and functionality for the work of the administrator and clients.
